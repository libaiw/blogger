  The press conference of September 12, Tim Cook Steve Jobs Theater, Cupertino, first extend my respect to Joe the Italian closer,people feeling the passage of time, and to cherish the memory of genius. iPhone market a decade, Joe closer to leave six years,
it has come to the iPhone 8,10 (evidently not 9, and 9 did not offend Who). IPhone then go to 101 jokes
to come to an end, now that is not in accordance with Arabic numerals, there is no need to back up.

  "Say hello to the future" is the slogan X of Apple, it sounds very science fiction. As a science fiction fan, I like
this phrase, can not help but shouted "buy buy buy."  full-screen, face recognition (Face ID), Animojo, wireless charging,
Features Etc.,plus the latest and greatest hardware integration, no doubt become the most advanced mobile X, of course, is the most expensive phone.
Looking back at more than 10 dollars to buy a iMac, now is a mobile phone money, it is not only a mobile phone from to replace the
the computer function,and the price is constantly to keep up with it? This may depend on the consumer does this buy. To be honest,X from the introduction of
in terms of new features, none can be called the future of technology, hardware features and characteristics of each technology products,of other
and have achieved varying degrees commercial  or other areas vendors.But each technology in various fields due to the  for various
restrictions reasons, and no large-scale promotion, such as face recognition technology, as early as two years before, he took his father Ma
goes face to do presentations everywhere, says It is on the future of shopping patterns by age face to eat really want to come. Time
past more than two years, we almost put the horse father forgot to say, because indeed, face recognition, especially at large
recognition crowds,and some technical difficulties, the need to further strengthen the network and hardware. The Apple believes  time is ripe
theto take advantage of their status to promote this age to see the face of a big step forward again. This can be said that the future of the
beginning, since as long as you have a face, there are children face to see to eat, you can "buy buy buy" high color value, you can enjoy high
discount,low color values, you can go to Snap get hold of stickers apply on the face. The future will be just as amazing time, "my face at least
is20% of it", "I face so long, you can offer to buy a horse." Pretty standard facecam with the so-called True Depth
3D be scanned camera, and 3D printing into the Apple store to sell, how good business ah.

  For large-scale application of the technology in the future, in addition to face recognition, there is wireless charging, this application also has a lot of
years, but has not reached large-scale commercial, although there are early Apple iWatch, AirPods can be wireless charging, but phone
on the wireless charging has lagged behind, and had to say in respect of some 6, and yet after three years only 8,10 launch. Wireless charging
promotion,a very significant meaning, that means have been the only device connected to the energy supply line may be thrown away,reach all
you can devices freely movable state. Whether at home or work office life will be a huge change. If the wireless
charging power again expanding, can be used on car or other large equipment, the future is indeed at hand. From this
perspective, Apple's innovative, trend-setting or strength and courage is admirable.

       The iWatch to enhance and support access to mobile phones, as well as a more revolutionary approach, even in leather
own life. IWatch just before the iPhone accessories, it now appears, iWatch completely independent
devices,and associated only with iCloud. Future iPhone will go high, squeezing PC and Laptop, or iTV market, become
worn devices and peripherals core or server. This will be the future of a big variable. There is a user said after watching,
hey, iWatch can call, and I would also like an iPhone Why? Rightly said ah, Phone original original
function is called, if the Watch can call, the headset can call, you can call glasses, shoes
can also be phones, cars can also be called, then I put a Phone doing in your pocket? whether there is the  iPhone
next-generation X,is indeed unknown X? As the title of the article talking about, whether this is the final chapter in the Phone era,
the era of future wearable device can really come?

I think it is faster, because Apple helps make one, not from the martial arts world No.
